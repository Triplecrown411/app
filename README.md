# Wizard Notes App

> A wizard is never late, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.

\- Gandalf

Wizard Notes is an planned to be a reminder app initially targeting Linux desktop and phones.

## Concept

- Notes are always snoozed on creation to a time when you expect to be able to deal with them
- You should reliably get reminded (eventually across devices when you do)
- Snoozed notes are hidden (although will be available somewhere in the app), the whole point is to remove cognitive load
- Notes can be archived, and then will no longer show up
- Uses standard system notifications

## Ponderings

- Possibly be able to produce ical / trigger email reminders
- Will probably enable x-device syncing of notes at some point
- Will likely try to build a GUI in GTK and a systemd service for prototype
- One day will consider mobile apps for Android and iPhone


## Why work on this for free?

- Because it is fun
- Because you want simple notes / reminder software
- Cognitive load is a problem in your life, and you don't need to see everything all the time
